# Git Push Instructions for Deployment Guides

Follow these steps to push the deployment guides to your Git repository:

## Step 1: Download the Files

First, download the deployment guide files from this Replit project:

1. **AWS Deployment Guide**: `AWS-DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. **GCP Deployment Guide**: `GCP-DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **Azure Deployment Guide**: `AZURE-DEPLOYMENT.md`
4. **Cloud Deployment Comparison**: `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-COMPARISON.md`

You can download these files by clicking on them in the file explorer and then using the "Download" button in the file viewer.

## Step 2: Add Files to Your Local Repository

Navigate to your local Git repository:

```bash
cd path/to/your/repository
```

Copy the downloaded files to your repository:

```bash
cp /path/to/downloads/*.md /path/to/your/repository/
```

## Step 3: Commit the Changes

Add the files to Git:

```bash
git add AWS-DEPLOYMENT.md GCP-DEPLOYMENT.md AZURE-DEPLOYMENT.md CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-COMPARISON.md
```

Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add cloud deployment guides for AWS, GCP, and Azure"
```

## Step 4: Push to Your Remote Repository

Push the changes to your remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main  # Replace "main" with your branch name if different
```

## Alternative: Direct Upload to GitHub

If you have a GitHub repository, you can also upload the files directly via the GitHub web interface:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop the downloaded MD files
4. Add a commit message like "Add cloud deployment guides"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Verification

After pushing to your repository, verify that the files appear correctly by checking your repository online or running:

```bash
git status
git log
```
