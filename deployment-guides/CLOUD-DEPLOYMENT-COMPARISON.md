## Recommendations

### Best for Microsoft Shops
If your organization is already invested in Microsoft technologies (Office 365, Teams, etc.), **Azure** provides the most seamless integration experience.

### Best for Cost Optimization
**Google Cloud Platform** often offers the best pricing, especially for consistent workloads due to their sustained use discounts.

### Best for Global Reach and Ecosystem
**AWS** has the most mature ecosystem and global infrastructure, making it ideal for organizations requiring extensive services and global presence.

### Best for Simplicity
For the simplest deployment approach, **Azure App Service** or **Google Cloud Run** offer the easiest path to deployment with minimal configuration.

## Migration Strategy

Regardless of which cloud provider you choose, we recommend:

1. **Start with a Test Environment**:
   - Deploy to a test/staging environment first
   - Validate functionality before production deployment

2. **Database Migration**:
   - SQLite to PostgreSQL migration using the built-in migration tools
   - Verify data integrity after migration

3. **Incremental Transition**:
   - Deploy the new system alongside the existing Windows application
   - Migrate users in phases to ensure smooth transition

4. **Monitor and Optimize**:
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
   - Optimize resources based on actual usage patterns

## Conclusion

All three major cloud providers offer excellent options for deploying the Schwarzenberg Tech Employee Time Management System. The choice ultimately depends on your organization's existing infrastructure, technical expertise, and specific requirements.
